# Preparation Exercises Programming for the Premaster Econometrics and Management Science
This repository contains preparation materials to prepare for the [Programming Course](https://courses.eur.nl/#/results?q=FEB22012,FEB22012X) that is offered as part of the [Premaster in Econometrics and Management Science](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/education/master/pre-master-programmes). These exercises are representative of what you have to do during the first Java tutorial of this course. In addition, the repository includes [an old exam](exam.md) from the course Introduction to Programming, which shows the level that is expected from students that start with course Programming.

# Preparation
Since 2020, the materials we use in the Introduction to Programming course are available online at [https://feb22012.ese.eur.nl/](https://feb22012.ese.eur.nl/). It is recommended to study these materials if you want to prepare either for Introduction to Programming or for Programming.

Before we had our own materials, we suggested Premaster students who wanted to prepare to use the first part of the free online course by John Purcell offered at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/), [Cave of Programming](https://courses.caveofprogramming.com/p/java-for-complete-beginners) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9DF6E4B45C36D411). The suggested materials to study were the topics up and until Part 19 (Static and final) and Part 28 (Casting Numerical Values). As a convenience, we created a [Youtube Playlist that only contains the videos on these topics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrX1UIgv0C_7J05ivJY19fAEhUu2NVoq7).

# Exercise: Prime Generator
In the first exercise you have to write a class that is able to generate consecutive prime numbers. The file `PrimeGenerator.java` is a stub that needs to be filled in with working code. The file `PrimeGeneratorTest.java` provides some unit tests. Running this class will test if the implementation in `PrimeGenerator` behaves as expected for a number of test cases.

# Exercise: Silly Counting
In th second exercise you have to write a class that counts number in a silly way: sometimes just the number must be given, but other times certain words must be given. The File `SillyCounting.java` is a stub that needs to be filled in working code. The file `SillyCountingTest.java` provides some unit tests. Running this class will test if the implementation in `SillyCounting` behaves as expected for a number of test cases.

# Suggested Exercises from the Course Materials

We have three more suggestions for exercises from our course materials that you can use to assess your level:

* ["Elements on the Diagonal" in Week 4 part 2](https://feb21011.ese.eur.nl/week-4/2-multidimensional-data)
* ["Cargo Hold" in Week 6 part 1](https://feb21011.ese.eur.nl/week-6/1-objects-within-objects)
* ["Averages" in Week 6 part 3](https://feb21011.ese.eur.nl/week-6/3-separating-user-interface-from-program-logic)

# Old exam
[The old exam](exam.md) consists of four exercises: a theory exercise, an exercise that focuses on input and output, an exercise that focuses on arrays, and a final exercise that focuses on object-oriented programming. Note that students were expected to make this exam in 2 hours, and they were only allowed to use an IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse) and the [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html).
