# Preparation Exercises Programming for the Premaster Econometrics and Management Science
This repository contains two preparation exercises to prepare for the [Programming Course](https://courses.eur.nl/#/results?q=FEB22012,FEB22012X) that is offered as part of the [Premaster in Econometrics and Management Science](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/education/master/pre-master-programmes). These exercises are representative of what you have to do during the first Java tutorial of this course.  

# Preparation
In case you are unfamiliar with Java, we suggest you to look at the first part of the free online course by John Purcell offered at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/), [Cave of Programming](https://courses.caveofprogramming.com/p/java-for-complete-beginners) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9DF6E4B45C36D411). We recommend you to study the topics up and until Part 19 (Static and final) and watch Part 28 (Casting Numerical Values) seperately. As a convenience, we created a [Youtube Playlist that only contains the videos on these topics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrX1UIgv0C_7J05ivJY19fAEhUu2NVoq7).

# Exercise: Prime Generator
In the first exercise you have to write a class that is able to generate consecutive prime numbers. The file `PrimeGenerator.java` is a stub that needs to be filled in with working code. The file `PrimeGeneratorTest.java` provides some unit tests. Running this class will test if the implementation in `PrimeGenerator` behaves as expected for a number of test cases.

# Exercise: Silly Counting
In th second exercise you have to write a class that counts number in a silly way: sometimes just the number must be given, but other times certain words must be given. The File `SillyCounting.java` is a stub that needs to be filled in working code. The file `SillyCountingTest.java` provides some unit tests. Running this class will test if the implementation in `SillyCounting` behaves as expected for a number of test cases.
